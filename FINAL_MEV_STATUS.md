# Final MEV Scanner Status

## Summary

### ✅ Scanner is Running Successfully

The MEV scanner is now operational and scanning current BSC blocks for vulnerabilities.

### Key Findings

1. **Vulnerability Found**: The scanner successfully detected the BEGO vulnerability
   - Contract: `0x68Cc90351a79A4c10078FE021bE430b7a12aaA09`
   - Detector: `erc20`
   - Found at current block (not the historical vulnerable block)
   - Log files saved in: `mev/vulnerability_logs/`

2. **ABI Issue Resolved**: 
   - The ABI parsing works correctly
   - The issue was using an invalid detector name ("ci")
   - Valid detectors: `all`, `erc20`, `reentrancy`, `arbitrary_call`, `typed_bug`, `balance_drain`

3. **Historical RPC Issue**:
   - The historical RPC (159.138.42.234:18545) is timing out
   - Using public BSC RPC instead: `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/`
   - Current block: ~56632071

### Current Configuration

```python
# Scanner settings
RPC: "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"
API Key: "SCVG9V74WV6VBZN583QZ9D3AW9VF45IMZP"
Binary: "./target/debug/ityfuzz"
Detectors: ["erc20", "reentrancy", "arbitrary_call", "typed_bug", "balance_drain"]
Timeout: 60 seconds per detector
Duration: 20 minutes total
```

### Directory Structure

```
mev/
├── work_dirs/          # ItyFuzz working directories (cleaned up if no vuln)
├── vulnerability_logs/ # Logs when vulnerabilities are found
├── fuzzing_logs/      # Detailed JSON reports
├── logs/              # Session logs and debug info
└── scanner_output.log # Main scanner output
```

### Running Processes

- `mev_current_block_scanner.py` - Main scanner finding contracts from current blocks
- `proven_mev_scanner.py` - Additional scanner running in parallel

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check scanner status
ps aux | grep python3 | grep -v grep

# Watch scanner output
tail -f mev/scanner_output.log

# Check for vulnerabilities
ls -la mev/vulnerability_logs/

# View vulnerability details
grep "Anyone can earn" mev/vulnerability_logs/*.log
```

### Important Notes

1. **Not Using Backtest Data**: The scanner is finding NEW contracts from current blocks, not using historical backtest data
2. **BEGO at Current Block**: The BEGO vulnerability detection at current block might be a false positive since the vulnerability was fixed after block 22315679
3. **Continuous Operation**: The scanner runs for 20 minutes, scanning recent blocks every 30 seconds
4. **Resource Management**: Work directories are automatically cleaned up if no vulnerability is found

### Next Steps

1. Let the scanner run to completion (20 minutes)
2. Review any vulnerabilities found in `mev/vulnerability_logs/`
3. Use the Forge scripts to simulate and validate findings
4. Consider increasing scan duration or adjusting parameters based on results
