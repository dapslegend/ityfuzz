# Final ItyFuzz Auto-Fuzzing System Status

## System Overview

We have successfully created a comprehensive auto-fuzzing system that:

1. **Finds ALL contracts** - No pre-filtering, lets ItyFuzz do the detection
2. **Discovers tokens automatically** - Multiple methods to find associated tokens  
3. **Preserves work directories** - Each contract's fuzzing state saved for MEV exploitation
4. **Runs continuously** - Can fuzz indefinitely with 30-minute rounds

## Key Components Built

### 1. `universal_contract_fuzzer.py`
- Finds contracts from blockchain transactions
- Discovers tokens via storage slots and Etherscan API
- Runs ItyFuzz with proper parameters
- Saves work directories for each contract
- Generates detailed reports

### 2. `run_continuous_fuzzing.sh` 
- Runs fuzzing rounds every 30 minutes
- Organizes logs into separate directories
- Tracks total vulnerabilities found

### 3. Supporting Scripts
- `test_contract_finder.py` - Tests contract discovery
- `test_ityfuzz_direct.sh` - Direct ItyFuzz testing
- Various other test scripts

## Technical Implementation

### Correct ItyFuzz Parameters
```bash
./target/debug/ityfuzz evm \
    -t "contract1,contract2,token1,token2" \  # All targets in one -t parameter
    -c bsc \                                   # Lowercase chain name
    --onchain-block-number <BLOCK> \
    -f \                                       # Fork mode
    --panic-on-bug \                          # Stop on first bug
    --detectors "all" \                       # Use all detectors
    --work-dir <WORK_DIR> \                   # Preserve corpus
    --onchain-url <RPC_URL>
```

### Key Discoveries
1. ItyFuzz expects comma-separated addresses in a single `-t` parameter
2. The `evm` subcommand must be specified
3. Chain name should be lowercase (`bsc` not `BSC`)
4. Work directories preserve corpus for MEV exploitation

## Current Challenges

### 1. Etherscan API Key
- The provided API key appears to be invalid for BSC
- ItyFuzz tries to fetch ABIs but fails when API returns error
- This causes ABI parsing errors even though fuzzing could work without ABIs

### 2. Historical Block Support
- Public BSC RPCs don't support forking at old blocks (22M-26M range)
- The historical RPC (159.198.35.169:8545) has limited block range
- Known vulnerable contracts were found at blocks that aren't supported

### 3. Contract Discovery
- Block scanning finds contracts but takes time
- Etherscan API v2 integration needs valid API key
- Currently falls back to known test contracts

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Etherscan API
- Obtain a valid BSC Etherscan API key
- Or modify ItyFuzz to work without ABIs (may need source code changes)

### 2. Use Archive Node
- Find a BSC archive node that supports historical blocks
- This would allow fuzzing at the exact vulnerable block numbers

### 3. Optimize Contract Discovery
- Implement BSCScan API for faster contract discovery
- Cache discovered contracts to avoid re-scanning
- Focus on recently deployed contracts

## Running the System

### One-time fuzzing (20 minutes):
```bash
python3 universal_contract_fuzzer.py
```

### Continuous fuzzing:
```bash
./run_continuous_fuzzing.sh
```

## Work Directory Structure

Each vulnerable contract gets its own directory:
```
work_dirs/
├── 0x1234..._56625754_1754467369/
│   ├── corpus/                    # Fuzzing corpus
│   ├── logs/                      # Detailed logs
│   └── vulnerability_metadata.json # MEV metadata
```

## Summary

The auto-fuzzing system is architecturally complete and follows best practices from the codebase. The main limitation is the invalid Etherscan API key causing ABI parsing errors. With a valid API key or modifications to skip ABI fetching, the system would be fully operational for discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities on BSC.
