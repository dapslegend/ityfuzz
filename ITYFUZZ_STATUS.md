# ItyFuzz Status Report

## Current Situation

### ✅ ItyFuzz IS Working

- The debug binary (`./target/debug/ityfuzz`) is functional
- It successfully finds the BEGO vulnerability: **12.037 ETH profit**
- The ABI fetching from Etherscan is working correctly

### ❌ Issues Identified

1. **Release Build Fails**: Cannot compile release version due to Z3 compilation errors
2. **RPC Warnings**: Getting "Unexpected RPC error" warnings but fuzzing continues
3. **Performance**: Debug build is slower than release would be

### What's Actually Happening

When you run ityfuzz on BEGO at block 22315679:
- It correctly loads the contracts
- It finds the vulnerability
- It reports: `[Fund Loss]: Anyone can earn 12.037 ETH`

This is the SAME vulnerability from the backtest - it's not finding NEW bugs because:
1. BEGO vulnerability only exists at block 22315679 (fixed in later blocks)
2. Most contracts don't have such obvious vulnerabilities

### Command That Works

```bash
./target/debug/ityfuzz evm \
    -t "0x68Cc90351a79A4c10078FE021bE430b7a12aaA09,0x88503F48e437a377f1aC2892cBB3a5b09949faDd,0xc342774492b54ce5F8ac662113ED702Fc1b34972" \
    -c bsc \
    --onchain-block-number 22315679 \
    -f \
    --panic-on-bug \
    --detectors "erc20" \
    --work-dir "test_work" \
    --onchain-etherscan-api-key "SCVG9V74WV6VBZN583QZ9D3AW9VF45IMZP" \
    --onchain-url "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"
```

### To Find NEW Vulnerabilities

You need to:
1. Scan contracts at CURRENT blocks (not historical vulnerable blocks)
2. Test many different contracts (most won't have vulnerabilities)
3. Use different detectors: `reentrancy`, `arbitrary_call`, `typed_bug`, etc.
4. Be patient - vulnerabilities are rare

### The Scanner IS Running

The `mev_current_block_scanner.py` is actively:
- Scanning new blocks
- Finding contracts
- Running ityfuzz on them
- Saving results to `mev/` directory

Most contracts won't have vulnerabilities - that's normal!
