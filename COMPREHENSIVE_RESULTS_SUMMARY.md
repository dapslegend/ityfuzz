# 📊 Comprehensive Backtest Results Summary

## Test Configuration
- **Detectors**: ALL enabled
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes per test (10 minutes for Seaman)
- **Optimizations**: All performance enhancements active

## Results So Far

### ✅ Successful Detections

1. **BEGO** - Fund Loss
   - **Detection Time**: < 5 minutes
   - **Vulnerability**: Anyone can earn 12.037 ETH
   - **Method**: `skim()` function exploitation
   - **Performance**: Successfully detected as expected

### ❌ Not Detected (Completed Tests)

1. **RES02** - Reentrancy
   - **Expected**: Should have been detected (was found in previous tests)
   - **Runtime**: 5 minutes
   - **Performance**: 19.93k exec/sec
   - **Note**: Surprising - this was detected in earlier runs

2. **LPC** - Fund Loss  
   - **Runtime**: 5 minutes
   - **Performance**: 26.65k exec/sec
   - **Note**: Complex multi-contract interaction

3. **AES** - Price Manipulation
   - **Runtime**: 5 minutes
   - **Performance**: 23.01k exec/sec
   - **Note**: Price oracle manipulation

### ⏳ Still Running

1. **Novo** - Reentrancy
   - **Runtime**: 3+ minutes
   - **Performance**: 21.19k exec/sec
   - **Status**: Still searching

### ⏸️ Not Started Yet

- HEALTH - Access Control
- Seaman - Access Control  
- CFC - Fund Loss
- ROI - Incorrect Calculation

## Key Observations

### 1. **Mixed Results with All Detectors**
- Enabling all detectors didn't guarantee detection of all vulnerabilities
- RES02 was NOT detected despite being found in earlier tests with specific detectors

### 2. **Performance Impact**
- Execution rates remain high (19-26k exec/sec)
- All detectors don't significantly impact performance

### 3. **Detection Challenges**
- Some vulnerabilities may require specific detector combinations
- Running all detectors might create noise or interference
- Time alone isn't always sufficient

## Hypothesis

The issue might be:
1. **Detector Interference**: All detectors running together might interfere with each other
2. **Oracle Priority**: Some oracles might be checked before others, causing early termination
3. **State Space**: With all detectors, the fuzzer might explore different paths

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Detector Sets**: Use specific detector combinations for different vulnerability types:
   - Fund Loss: `erc20,balance_drain`
   - Reentrancy: `reentrancy,erc20`
   - Access Control: `arbitrary_call,typed_bug`

2. **Longer Runtime**: Some complex vulnerabilities might need 10-15 minutes

3. **Multiple Runs**: Run tests multiple times as fuzzing has randomness

## Next Steps

1. Wait for remaining tests to complete
2. Re-run failed tests with targeted detector sets
3. Analyze why RES02 wasn't detected with all detectors
