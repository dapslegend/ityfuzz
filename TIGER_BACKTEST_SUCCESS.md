# üéâ TIGER BACKTEST - SUCCESSFULLY BUILT AND RUNNING!

## Mission Accomplished!

We successfully fixed the z3-sys compilation issue and got the Tiger backtest running with your API key!

## What We Fixed

### 1. System Dependencies ‚úÖ
- Installed gcc-11 and g++-11 for better compatibility
- Installed Python setuptools to replace missing distutils
- Created distutils symlink for Python 3.13 compatibility

### 2. Code Fix ‚úÖ
Fixed the compilation error in `/workspace/src/evm/onchain/flashloan.rs`:
```rust
// Before: convert_u256_to_h256(interp.stack.peek(2).unwrap())
// After: interp.stack.peek(2).unwrap()
```

### 3. Build Success ‚úÖ
```bash
cd /workspace && cargo build --release
# Successfully built: /workspace/target/release/ityfuzz
```

## Tiger Backtest Running

The Tiger backtest is now running with:
- ‚úÖ Your API key `SCVG9V74WV6VBZN583QZ9D3AW9VF45IMZP` is working
- ‚úÖ Locally compiled ityfuzz with V2 API support
- ‚úÖ All tests are executing (SEAMAN, RES02, LPC, BEGO, BBOX)
- ‚úÖ Proper coverage metrics being collected

## Current Status

The tests are running but haven't found vulnerabilities within the 60-second timeout. This could be due to:
1. Lower execution speed (~300-600 exec/sec vs expected 4000-5000)
2. Network latency with public RPC endpoints
3. Need for longer timeouts or different oracle configurations

## To Improve Results

1. **Increase timeout**: Change `TIMEOUT=60` to `TIMEOUT=300` in the script
2. **Use a faster RPC**: Replace public RPC with a dedicated node
3. **Run specific oracles**: Previous successful runs used specific detectors like `erc20`

## Proof It's Working

From the BEGO log:
```
INFO [Testcase #0] run time: 0h-0m-54s, clients: 1, corpus: 98, objectives: 0
INFO 0x88503f48e437a377f1ac2892cbb3a5b09949fadd: 48.96% Instruction Covered
INFO 0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c: 57.63% Instruction Covered
INFO 0xc342774492b54ce5f8ac662113ed702fc1b34972: 52.24% Instruction Covered
```

The fuzzer is actively exploring the contracts and building coverage!

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **z3-sys compilation issue: FIXED**
‚úÖ **ityfuzz built from source: SUCCESS**
‚úÖ **Tiger backtest running: CONFIRMED**
‚úÖ **API key working: VERIFIED**
