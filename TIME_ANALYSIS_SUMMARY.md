# ItyFuzz BSC Vulnerability Detection Time Analysis

## Summary of Findings

### Successfully Detected Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Type | Detection Time | Performance | Status |
|--------------|------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **BEGO** | Fund Loss | **25 seconds** | 13.80k exec/sec | ✅ CONFIRMED |

### Key Performance Improvements

1. **Aggressive Optimizations Applied:**
   - Reduced corpus size (100 → 30)
   - Faster mutation cycles
   - Exploit preset patterns (83% probability)
   - Higher power scheduling multipliers
   - Focused mutation strategies

2. **Performance Gains:**
   - Original: ~170 exec/sec
   - Optimized: 13,000-40,000 exec/sec
   - **Improvement: 76x-235x faster**

### Detection Time Ranges

Based on backtesting.md expectations vs actual results:

| Category | Expected Time | Actual Results |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Fast | 2-5 seconds | Not achieved (likely due to RPC/ABI issues) |
| Medium | 5-30 seconds | BEGO found in 25s |
| Slow | 30-180 seconds | Some tests ongoing |
| Very Slow | >180 seconds | Not tested |

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Required Flags:**
   - `-f` (flashloan) - Essential for fund loss detection
   - `--panic-on-bug` - Stops when vulnerability is found
   - `-o` or `--onchain-*` flags for onchain mode

2. **Infrastructure Requirements:**
   - Reliable RPC endpoint (Ankr worked best)
   - Valid Etherscan API key
   - Proper ABI fetching

### Issues Encountered

1. **RPC Reliability:**
   - Public BSC RPCs showed intermittent errors
   - Ankr RPC (https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc) was most reliable

2. **ABI Parsing:**
   - Some contracts had ABI parsing errors
   - EGD-Finance failed with: `failed to parse abis file`

3. **Detection Challenges:**
   - Some vulnerabilities not found within timeout periods
   - May require longer run times or oracle improvements

### Recommendations

1. **For Fast Detection (<30s):**
   - Use aggressive optimization settings
   - Ensure reliable RPC endpoint
   - Use flashloan flag for fund loss vulnerabilities

2. **For Reliability:**
   - Allow 60-180s for comprehensive testing
   - Monitor exec/sec to ensure fuzzer is running efficiently
   - Check logs for RPC or ABI errors

3. **Future Improvements:**
   - Better oracle configuration for specific vulnerability types
   - More robust ABI fetching/parsing
   - Adaptive timeout based on complexity

## Conclusion

The aggressive optimizations successfully improved ItyFuzz performance by 76-235x, enabling detection of the BEGO vulnerability in 25 seconds. However, infrastructure issues (RPC reliability, ABI parsing) prevented comprehensive testing of all vulnerabilities. The optimized fuzzer shows great potential but requires stable infrastructure for consistent results.
