# ðŸŽ¯ ItyFuzz Optimization Summary

## Key Findings

### 1. **Configuration Matters Most**
- âœ… **Correct block numbers**: Critical for vulnerability detection
- âœ… **Multiple addresses**: Essential for cross-contract exploits
- âœ… **Simple is better**: Basic flags often outperform complex setups

### 2. **Performance Results**
- **BEGO**: Found in 47s (279,825 ETH profit via mint)
- **BBOX**: Found in 142s (0.004 ETH profit via withdraw)
- **Execution speed**: 9-28k exec/sec without special optimizations

### 3. **False Positives**
- SEAMAN showed 30,179 ETH profit (unrealistic)
- BEGO showed 279,825 ETH profit (also suspicious)
- Need better profit validation

### 4. **About Objectives**
- "objectives: 0" is normal behavior
- Objectives track NEW coverage, not bugs
- Finding a bug doesn't increment objectives

## Recommended Usage

### For MEV Bots:
```bash
# Simple, effective configuration
ityfuzz evm \
    -t "WBNB,TARGET,ROUTER,TOKEN1,TOKEN2" \
    -c bsc \
    --onchain-block-number BLOCK \
    -f \
    --panic-on-bug \
    --onchain-etherscan-api-key $API_KEY \
    --onchain-url "https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc"
```

### Key Improvements Made:
1. âœ… Lowered profit threshold to 0.0001 ETH
2. âœ… Enhanced reentrancy detection with profit tracking
3. âœ… Added balance drain oracle
4. âœ… Fixed flashloan tracking for target contracts

### What Works Well:
- Multiple contract addresses improve detection
- ERC20 oracle is essential for fund loss
- Correct block numbers are critical
- 2-3 minute runs often sufficient

### What Needs Work:
- Better profit validation (too many false positives)
- Support for non-flashloan chains (Anvil)
- Complex transaction performance
- ABI parsing errors on some contracts

## Bottom Line

ItyFuzz is effective at finding vulnerabilities when:
1. Given correct block numbers and addresses
2. Using appropriate oracles (mainly `erc20`)
3. Running for 2-5 minutes
4. Including all related contracts

The fuzzer is good as-is for most use cases. The main issue is false positives in profit calculations, not the fuzzing engine itself.
