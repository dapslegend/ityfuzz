# BEGO Vulnerability Status - Current Block Report

## Contract Status at Current Block (56630797)

### ✅ Contract Still Exists
- **Address**: `0xc342774492b54ce5F8ac662113ED702Fc1b34972`
- **Name**: Binance GeoDB Coin
- **Symbol**: BGEO
- **Bytecode Size**: 21,792 characters

### 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis

#### Historical Vulnerability (Block 22315679)
- **Confirmed in backtest**: YES
- **Profit Found**: 7.433 - 12.036 ETH
- **Root Cause**: `isSigners([])` returns `true` for empty arrays

#### Current Status
Due to public RPC limitations, we cannot directly test the vulnerability at the current block. However:

1. **Contract is still deployed** at the same address
2. **Name and symbol match** the original vulnerable contract
3. **Testing requires** an archive node or local fork to attempt exploitation

```

### 🚨 Vulnerability Mechanism

The vulnerability allows minting unlimited BEGO tokens by passing empty signature arrays:

```solidity
// Vulnerable function
function isSigners(address[] memory _signers) returns (bool) {
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < _signers.length; i++) {
        if (!_containsSigner(_signers[i])) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;  // Returns true for empty array!
}
```

### 🔧 Testing Limitations

To properly test if the vulnerability still exists at the current block, you would need:

1. **Archive Node Access**: Public BSC nodes don't support state access at historical blocks
2. **Local Fork**: Using Anvil/Hardhat to fork current BSC state
3. **Test Transaction**: Attempt `mint()` with empty signature arrays

### 📝 Conclusion

- **Contract exists** at current block with same address
- **Vulnerability was confirmed** at historical block 22315679
- **Current vulnerability status** cannot be determined without proper testing environment
- **If still vulnerable**, potential profit depends on current BEGO/WBNB liquidity

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. This analysis is for educational/security research purposes
2. The vulnerability may have been patched via proxy upgrade or migration
3. Actual testing should only be done in controlled environments
4. Consider responsible disclosure if vulnerability still exists
