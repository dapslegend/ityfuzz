# ðŸŽ¯ Critical Insight: Multiple Addresses in ItyFuzz

## Why Multiple Addresses Are Essential

When fuzzing smart contracts, passing multiple addresses to ItyFuzz dramatically improves vulnerability detection because:

### 1. **Contract Ecosystem Context**
Most DeFi vulnerabilities involve interactions between multiple contracts:
- **Token contracts** (WBNB, USDT, etc.)
- **Target contract** (the vulnerable one)
- **Helper/Router contracts**
- **LP pairs or pools**

### 2. **Attack Sequence Construction**
ItyFuzz needs these addresses to:
- Build valid transaction sequences
- Understand token flows
- Explore cross-contract calls
- Test integration points

### 3. **Example: BEGO Vulnerability**
```
Addresses passed:
1. 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c - WBNB (token context)
2. 0x88503F48e437a377f1aC2892cBB3a5b09949faDd - Vulnerable contract
3. 0xc342774492b54ce5F8ac662113ED702Fc1b34972 - Related contract

Result: Found fund loss via skim() function
```

### 4. **Example: RES02 Reentrancy**
```
Addresses passed:
1. WBNB - For value transfers
2. Target contract - Has reentrancy
3. Helper contract - Triggers the vulnerability

Result: Complex reentrancy pattern discovered
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Always Include Token Contracts**
- WBNB/WETH for native token operations
- Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) for value calculations
- Project tokens for specific interactions

### 2. **Include Related Contracts**
- Routers/Factories
- Admin/Owner contracts
- Oracle contracts
- Any contract the target interacts with

### 3. **How to Find Related Addresses**
- Check contract source for hardcoded addresses
- Look at recent transactions for frequent interactions
- Include contracts from the same deployment
- Check emit events for contract addresses

## Impact on Fuzzing

### With Single Address:
- Limited to self-contained bugs
- Can't test integration vulnerabilities
- Missing context for value flows
- Lower detection rate

### With Multiple Addresses:
- Full ecosystem simulation
- Cross-contract exploit chains
- Realistic attack scenarios
- Higher detection rate

## Recommendation for MEV Bots

When scanning for vulnerabilities:
1. **Collect all related addresses** from:
   - Contract source code
   - Recent transactions
   - Event logs
   - Factory deployments

2. **Standard inclusion list**:
   ```bash
   WBNB/WETH + TARGET + ROUTERS + TOKENS + ORACLES
   ```

3. **Typical command**:
   ```bash
   ityfuzz evm -t "WBNB,TARGET,ROUTER,TOKEN1,TOKEN2,ORACLE" ...
   ```

This approach significantly increases the chances of finding profitable vulnerabilities!
