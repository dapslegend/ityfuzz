# üö® CRITICAL CORRECTIONS MADE

## Major Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **SEAMAN - Wrong Everything!**
‚ùå **WRONG**: 
- Block: 22142525
- Addresses: Only 2 contracts

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
- Block: **23467515** 
- Addresses: **4 contracts** including USDT (0x55d398...)

### 2. **RES02 - Completely Different!**
‚ùå **WRONG**:
- Block: 23695904
- Addresses: Only 3 contracts
- Type: Listed as "Reentrancy"

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
- Block: **21948016**
- Addresses: **8 contracts** (including duplicates)
- Type: **Price Manipulation** (not reentrancy!)

### 3. **Impact of Wrong Configuration**
- Wrong block = Wrong contract state
- Missing addresses = Missing attack vectors
- Wrong vulnerability type = Wrong oracles

## Why This Matters

1. **Block Number**: Determines exact contract code and state
2. **Address Count**: More addresses = more interaction possibilities
3. **Vulnerability Type**: Affects which oracles can detect it

## Key Insights

- SEAMAN is actually a **Fund Loss** bug (not Access Control)
- RES02 is **Price Manipulation** (not Reentrancy)
- More addresses dramatically improve detection rates

This explains why our previous tests had poor detection rates!
